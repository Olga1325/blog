## Overview

1. This week we have a new teacher in mathematical analysis.
2. On Tuesday, I was offered to take psrt in a rowingg competiyion, but I refused, because it requires strong hands, and after the exercise I was exhausted. 
3. On Thursday, a new coffe shop opened next to the university and I was offered free coffee. The barista drew me a cream heart. 
4. And of course I worked on programming code and did labs on operating systems.
